## What is Epusdt?

**Epusdt** (Easy Payment USDT) is a self-hosted **multi-chain, multi-token crypto payment gateway** built with Go. It started as a TRC20-only solution and evolved into a broader **multi-chain receiving platform**, allowing websites and applications to accept crypto payments across multiple networks and token types. No third-party custody, no platform fees — funds go directly into your wallet.

> **GitHub Star 3000+** · **10+ supported platform integrations** · **Top real-world adoption among crypto payment tools**

Deploy it privately, integrate with the HTTP API, and start receiving crypto payments in minutes.

### Supported Networks and Tokens

| Network | Tokens |
|---------|--------|
| **TRC20** (Tron) | USDT, TRX |
| **ERC20** (Ethereum) | USDT, USDC, ETH |

## How It Works

Epusdt listens to supported blockchain APIs or RPC nodes across multiple networks such as TRC20, ERC20, BEP20, and Polygon. It captures incoming token transfers in real time and matches ownership using **amount differentiation** and **time-bounded locks**:

```text
Workflow:
1. A customer initiates payment and needs to send 20.05 USDT
2. The system searches for an available wallet-address + amount combination
3. If address_1:20.05 is free -> lock it for 10 minutes and return it
4. If already occupied -> add 0.0001 and try the next amount combination
5. Background listeners keep watching wallet deposits and mark the order paid once the amount matches
```
